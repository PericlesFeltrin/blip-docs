### Configure

Postman offers a configurable variable map which is essentially a set of key-value pairs. It allows you to create commonly used variables that can be reference across multiple requests. You can read more about it [here](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v5/postman/environments_and_globals/variables). Before to start using Blip's Postman Collection you need to add the `Authorization` variable.

* Go to **Edit** menu option and access the collection's variables.
