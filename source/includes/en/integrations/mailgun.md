### Send e-mail

Sending an e-mail is a common task for anyone developing a bot. Alerts or confirmation of information are some of the common scenarios for this demand. Blip abstracts the whole process of sending and receiving e-mails to your bot.

| Name    | Description                          |
|---------|--------------------------------------|
| id      | Unique identifier of the command.    |
| to      | **{{e-mail}}@mailgun.gw.msging.net** |
| type    | **text/plain**                       |
| content | **{{message}}**                      |

<aside class="notice">
Note: Remember to replace the variable {{e-mail}} for the email you want to send a message (for instance: <b> xpto%40xpto.com</b>). Since every LIME node has the @ character, it is required to sign @ the email by its corresponding ASCII code (%40). You must also define message you want to send the user, replacing the {{message}} variable according to the LIME protocol (for instance: <b>Welcome to our service! How can I help you?</b>).

```javascript
client.sendMessage({
    id: Lime.Guid(),
    type: "text/plain",
    to: "xpto%40xpto.com@mailgun.gw.msging.net",
    content: "Welcome to our service! How can I help you?"
});
```

```python
