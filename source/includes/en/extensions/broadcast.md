## Broadcast

The **broadcast** extension allows creation and management of distribution lists and their members for sending messages to multiple destinations simultaneously.

Each distribution list has a unique address in the format `list-name@broadcast.msging.net` in addition to the members, who are the recipients of messages sent to this list. Only the chatbot that created a remote list has permission to send messages to it.

Notifications are forwarded to the chatbot when received by the extension.

In order to use **broadcast** extension features, you must send commands with the following properties:

| Name     | Description                                       |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| id       | Unique identifier of the command.                 |
| method   | The command verb                                  |
| resource | The schedule document.                            |
| type     | **"application/vnd.iris.distribution-list+json"** |
| uri      | **/lists**                                        |
| to       | **postmaster@broadcast.msging.net**               |

The command's properties `resource` and `method` can change according to the feature.
An schedule object passed as a document `resource` has the following properties:

| Property     | Description                        | Example                   |
|--------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **identity** | Identifier of a distribution list. | news@broadcast.msging.net |

#### Default list

Blip automatically creates a distribution list with all clients that have already contacted your chatbot. Its address is `[bot-identifier]+senders@broadcast.msging.net` where `bot-identifier` is the identifier of your chatbot, which is used with the access key for authentication.

For example, for a chatbot with identifier `mychatbot`, this list address would be `mychatbot+senders@broadcast.msging.net`.

#### Replacement variables

It is possible to use contact replacement variables in the sent messages. For more information, please check the documentation of the [**Contacts** extension](#contacts).

#### Availability

The Broadcast service is available in the following domains:

| Domain    | Available | Observation                                         |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Messenger | x         | Needed initial user interaction with chatbot        |
| Blip Chat | x         | Not necessary initial user interaction with chatbot |
| Skype     | x         | Needed initial user interaction with chatbot        |
| SMS       | x         | Not necessary initial user interaction with chatbot |
| Telegram  | x         | Needed initial user interaction with chatbot        |
| Workplace | x         | Needed initial user interaction with chatbot        |

### Create a list

```javascript
client.addMessageReceiver('text/plain', async (message) => {
  await client.sendCommand({
    id: Lime.Guid(),
    to: "postmaster@broadcast.msging.net",
    method: Lime.CommandMethod.SET,
    type: "application/vnd.iris.distribution-list+json",
    uri: "/lists",
    resource: {
        "identity": "your_distributionList@broadcast.msging.net"
    }
  });
});
```

```python
result = await client.process_command_async(
  Command.from_json(
    {  
      'id': '{{$guid}}1',
      'to': 'postmaster@broadcast.msging.net',
      'method': 'set',
      'type': 'application/vnd.iris.distribution-list+json',
      'uri': '/lists',
      'resource': {  
        'identity': 'your_distributionList@broadcast.msging.net'
      }
    }
  )
)
```

```http
POST https://http.msging.net/commands HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Key {YOUR_TOKEN}

{  
  "id": "{{$guid}}1",
  "to": "postmaster@broadcast.msging.net",
  "method": "set",
  "type": "application/vnd.iris.distribution-list+json",
  "uri": "/lists",
  "resource": {  
    "identity": "your_distributionList@broadcast.msging.net"
  }
}
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": "1",
  "from": "postmaster@broadcast.msging.net/#irismsging1",
  "to": "contact@msging.net/default",
  "method": "set",
  "status": "success"
}
```

```csharp
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Lime.Protocol;
using Take.Blip.Client;
using Take.Blip.Client.Receivers;
using Take.Blip.Client.Extensions.Broadcast;

namespace Extensions
{
    public class SampleMessageReceiver : IMessageReceiver
    {
        private readonly IBroadcastExtension _broadcastExtension;

        public SampleMessageReceiver(IBroadcastExtension broadcastExtension)
        {
            _broadcastExtension = broadcastExtension;
        }

        public async Task ReceiveAsync(Message message, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
            var listName = "your_distributionList";

            await _broadcastExtension.CreateDistributionListAsync(listName);
        }
    }
}
```

Before making a broadcast, it is necessary to create a distribution list and add some members to it. To create a distribution list with `your_distributionList` identifier you must send command with `SET` method and a `resource` document with identity equal to `your_distributionList@broadcast.msging.net`.

### Get all lists

```javascript
client.addMessageReceiver('text/plain', async (message) => {
  await client.sendCommand({
    id: Lime.Guid(),
    to: "postmaster@broadcast.msging.net",
    method: Lime.CommandMethod.GET,
    uri: "/lists"
  });
});
```

```python
result = await client.process_command_async(
  Command.from_json(
    {  
      'id': '{{$guid}}',
      'to': 'postmaster@broadcast.msging.net',
      'method': 'get',
      'uri': '/lists'
    }
  )
)
```

```http
POST https://http.msging.net/commands HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Key {YOUR_TOKEN}

{  
  "id": "{{$guid}}",
  "to": "postmaster@broadcast.msging.net",

  "type": "application/vnd.lime.collection+json",
  "resource": {
    "total": 2,
    "itemType": "application/vnd.lime.identity",
    "items": [
      "list1@msging.net",
      "contact+senders@msging.net"
    ]
  }
}
```

```csharp

using Take.Blip.Client.Receivers;
using Take.Blip.Client.Extensions.Broadcast;

namespace Extensions
{
    public class SampleMessageReceiver : IMessageReceiver
    {
        private readonly IBroadcastExtension _broadcastExtension;

        public SampleMessageReceiver(IBroadcastExtension broadcastExtension)
        {
            _broadcastExtension = broadcastExtension;
        }

        public async Task ReceiveAsync(Message message, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
            // 0 is the initial position (number of lists to be skipped)
            // 5 is the number os lists to be returned
            await _broadcastExtension.GetRecipientsAsynGetAllDistributionListsAsync(0, 5, cancellationToken);
        }
    }
}
```

To get all distribution lists associated with your chatbot, you must send a command with `GET` method.

### Delete a list

Delete a distribution lists.

```javascript
client.addMessageReceiver('text/plain', async (message) => {
    await client.sendCommand({  
        id: Lime.Guid(),
        method: Lime.CommandMethod.DELETE,
        uri: '/lists/{{distribution_list_name}}@broadcast.msging.net'
    });
});
```

```python
result = await client.process_command_async(
  Command.from_json(
    {  
      'id': '{{$guid}}',
      'to': 'postmaster@broadcast.msging.net',
      'method': 'delete',

        public SampleMessageReceiver(IBroadcastExtension broadcastExtension)
        {
            _broadcastExtension = broadcastExtension;
        }

        public async Task ReceiveAsync(Message message, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
            var listName = "your_distributionList";

            await _broadcastExtension.DeleteListAsync(listName);
        }
    }
}
```

### Add a member to list

```javascript
client.addMessageReceiver('text/plain', async (message) => {
  await client.sendCommand({  
      id: Lime.Guid(),
      to: "postmaster@broadcast.msging.net",
      method: Lime.CommandMethod.SET,
      uri: "/lists/your_distributionList@broadcast.msging.net/recipients",
      type: "application/vnd.lime.identity",
      resource: message.from //user identity
    });
});
```

```python
result = await client.process_command_async(
  Command.from_json(
    {  
      'id': '{{$guid}}',
      'to': 'postmaster@broadcast.msging.net',
      'method': 'set',
      'uri': '/lists/your_distributionList@broadcast.msging.net/recipients',
      'type': 'application/vnd.lime.identity',
      'resource': '551100001111@0mn.io'
    }
  )
)
```

```http

Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Key {YOUR_TOKEN}

{  
  "id": "{{$guid}}",
  "to": "postmaster@broadcast.msging.net",
  "method": "set",
  "uri": "/lists/your_distributionList@broadcast.msging.net/recipients",
  "type": "application/vnd.lime.identity",
  "resource": "551100001111@0mn.io"
}
```

  "from": "postmaster@broadcast.msging.net/#irismsging1",
  "to": "contact@msging.net/default",
  "method": "set",
  "status": "success"
}
```

```csharp
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Lime.Protocol;
using Take.Blip.Client;
using Take.Blip.Client.Receivers;
using Take.Blip.Client.Extensions.Broadcast;

namespace Extensions
{
    public class SampleMessageReceiver : IMessageReceiver
    {
        private readonly IBroadcastExtension _broadcastExtension;

        public SampleMessageReceiver(IBroadcastExtension broadcastExtension)
        {
            _broadcastExtension = broadcastExtension;
        }

        public async Task ReceiveAsync(Message message, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
            var listName = "your_distributionList";

            await _broadcastExtension.AddRecipientAsync(listName, Identity.Parse("551100001111@0mn.io"));
        }
    }
}
```

After creating a distribution list, you must add some members to receive your broadcasts. To add a member with `551100001111@0mn.io` identity to a list with `your_distributionList` identifier, you must send a command with `SET` method and `resource` document equal to a member identity (`551100001111@0mn.io`). Note that the command URI also must contains the list identifier (`/lists/your_distributionList@broadcast.msging.net/recipients`)

### Remove members from list

```javascript
client.addMessageReceiver('text/plain', async (message) => {
  await client.sendCommand({  
    id: Lime.Guid(),
    to: "postmaster@broadcast.msging.net",
    method: Lime.CommandMethod.DELETE,
    uri: "/lists/your_distributionList@broadcast.msging.net/recipients/user_identity@0mn.io"
  });
});
```

```python
result = await client.process_command_async(
  Command.from_json(
    {  
      'id': '{{$guid}}',
      'to': 'postmaster@broadcast.msging.net',
      'method': 'delete',
      'uri': '/lists/your_distributionList@broadcast.msging.net/recipients/551100001111@0mn.io'
    }
  )
)
```

```http
POST https://http.msging.net/commands HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Key {YOUR_TOKEN}

{  
  "id": "{{$guid}}",
  "to": "postmaster@broadcast.msging.net",
  "method": "delete",
  "uri": "/lists/your_distributionList@broadcast.msging.net/recipients/551100001111@0mn.io"
}
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": "4",
  "from": "postmaster@broadcast.msging.net/#irismsging1",
  "to": "contact@msging.net/default",
  "method": "set",
  "status": "success"
}
```

```csharp
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Lime.Protocol;
using Take.Blip.Client;
using Take.Blip.Client.Receivers;
using Take.Blip.Client.Extensions.Broadcast;

namespace Extensions
{
    public class SampleMessageReceiver : IMessageReceiver
    {
        private readonly IBroadcastExtension _broadcastExtension;

        public SampleMessageReceiver(IBroadcastExtension broadcastExtension)
        {
            _broadcastExtension = broadcastExtension;
        }

        public async Task ReceiveAsync(Message message, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
            var listName = "your_distributionList";

            await _broadcastExtension.DeleteRecipientAsync(listName, Identity.Parse("551100001111@0mn.io"));
        }
    }
}
```

As the same way you add some members into a distribution list, it is possible to remove its members. To remove a member with `551100001111@0mn.io` identity from a list with `your_distributionList` identifier, you must send a command with `DELETE` method and command URI with the list and memeber identifier (`/lists/your_distributionList@broadcast.msging.net/recipients/551100001111@0mn.io`)

### Get all members of a list

```javascript
client.addMessageReceiver('text/plain', async (message) => {
  await client.sendCommand({
    id: Lime.Guid(),
    to: "postmaster@broadcast.msging.net",
    method: Lime.CommandMethod.GET,
    uri: "/lists/your_distributionList@broadcast.msging.net/recipients?$skip=0&$take=5"
  });
});
```

```python
result = await client.process_command_async(
  Command.from_json(
    {  
      'id': '{{$guid}}',
      'to': 'postmaster@broadcast.msging.net',
      'method': 'get',
      'uri': '/lists/your_distributionList@broadcast.msging.net/recipients?$skip=0&$take=5'
    }
  )
)
```

```http

{  
  "id": "{{$guid}}",
  "to": "postmaster@broadcast.msging.net",
  "method": "get",
  "uri": "/lists/your_distributionList@broadcast.msging.net/recipients?$skip=0&$take=5"
}
```

    "itemType": "application/vnd.lime.identity",
    "items": [

      "list1@msging.net",
      "list2@msging.net",
      "list3@msging.net",
      "list4@msging.net"
    ]
  }
}
```

```csharp
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

using Take.Blip.Client.Extensions.Broadcast;

namespace Extensions
{
    public class SampleMessageReceiver : IMessageReceiver
    {
        private readonly IBroadcastExtension _broadcastExtension;

        public SampleMessageReceiver(IBroadcastExtension broadcastExtension)
        {
            _broadcastExtension = broadcastExtension;
        }

        public async Task ReceiveAsync(Message message, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
            var listName = "your_distributionList";

            await _broadcastExtension.GetRecipientsAsync(listName, 0, 5, cancellationToken);
        }
    }
}
```

To get all members of a distribution list, you must send a command with `GET` method and command URI with the list identifier (`/lists/your_distributionList@broadcast.msging.net/recipients`)

| Property | Description                          | Example |
|----------|--------------------------------------|---------|
| **skip** | The number of members to be skipped  | 0       |
| **take** | The number of members to be returned | 100     |

### Send message

```javascript
client.addMessageReceiver('text/plain', async (message) => {
  await client.sendCommand({
    id: Lime.Guid(),
    to: 'your_distributionList@broadcast.msging.net',
    type: 'text/plain',
    content: 'Hello participants of this list!'
  });
});
```

```python
def message_receiver(message: Message) -> None:
  client.send_message(
    Message(
      'text/plain',
      'Hello participants of this list!',
      to='your_distributionList@broadcast.msging.net'
    )
  )

client.add_message_receiver(Receiver(lambda m: m.type_n == 'text/plain', message_receiver))
```

```http
POST https://http.msging.net/messages HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

}
```

namespace Extensions
{
    public class SampleMessageReceiver : IMessageReceiver
    {
        private readonly IBroadcastExtension _broadcastExtension;

        public SampleMessageReceiver(IBroadcastExtension broadcastExtension)
        {
            _broadcastExtension = broadcastExtension;
        }

        public async Task ReceiveAsync(Message message, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
            var listName = "your_distributionList";

            await _broadcastExtension.SendMessageAsync(listName, new PlainText { Text = "Hello participants of this list!" });
        }
    }
}
```

If you already have a distribution list with some members, you can send messages to this list. Any message sent to a specific list will be received by all of its members.

### Send message with replacement variable

```javascript
client.addMessageReceiver('text/plain', async (message) => {
  await client.sendMessage({  
    id: Lime.Guid(),
    to: "your_distributionList@broadcast.msging.net",
    type: "text/plain",
    content: "Hello ${contact.name}, come to check out our prices!"
  });
});
```

```python
def message_receiver(message: Message) -> None:
  client.send_message(
    Message(
      'text/plain',
      'Hello ${contact.name}, come to check out our prices!',
      to='your_distributionList@broadcast.msging.net'
    )
  )

client.add_message_receiver(Receiver(lambda m: m.type_n == 'text/plain', message_receiver))
```

```http

  "type": "text/plain",
  "content": "Hello ${contact.name}, come to check out our prices!"
}
```

namespace Extensions
{
    public class SampleMessageReceiver : IMessageReceiver
    {
        private readonly IBroadcastExtension _broadcastExtension;

        public SampleMessageReceiver(IBroadcastExtension broadcastExtension)
        {
            _broadcastExtension = broadcastExtension;
        }

        public async Task ReceiveAsync(Message message, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
            var listName = "your_distributionList";

            await _broadcastExtension.SendMessageAsync(listName, new PlainText { Text = "Hello ${contact.name}, come to check out our prices!" });
        }
    }
}
```
