# Webhook

**Webhook's** *chatbot* enables integration via **HTTP endpoints** to exchange messages, notifications and commands.

1. Send messages

To send messages, it is necessary to make a `HTTP POST` request to URL provided on portal (chatbot settings section). The request must contain an authorization header (`Authorization`) with `Key` type, as showed on chatbot settings.

The message data must be sent on the request `body`. The message must be a *JSON* on LIME protocol format. For more details go to [protocol documentation](http://limeprotocol.org/#message).

Example

Imagine a chatbot with a **blipmessaginghubapp** identifier. To send a message from this bot to a Blip user, use:

```
POST https://{{contract.id}}.http.msging.net/messages HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Key bWVzc2FnaW5naHViQHRha2VuZXQuY29tLmJyOjEyMzQ=
Content-Length: 131

{
  "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000",
  "to": "551100001111@0mn.io",
  "type": "text/plain",
  "content": "Hello, how can I help you?"
}
```

Note: For this sample, `bWVzc2FnaW5naHViQHRha2VuZXQuY29tLmJyOjEyMzQ` is a valid `Key` for **blipmessaginghubapp** chatbot.

For more information about messages, check the [**Messages** documentation page](.#/docs/concepts/messages) or the [supported content types specification](.#/docs/content-types).

2. Receiving notification

All notifications will be delivered on the configured chatbot's notification URL. Each notification contains the _status_ of messages. Observe that notifications are sent by *clients*, informing if received or not some message.

A sample of notification is presented below. This notification will be deliverd as a `HTTP POST` request on the chatbot notification URL.

```
{
  "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000",
  "from": "551100001111@0mn.io/4ac58r6e3",
  "to": "blipmessaginghubapp@msging.net/7a8fr233x",
  "event": "received"
}
```

For more information, check the [**Notification** documentation page](.#/docs/concepts/notifications)



3. Receiving messages

Similar to notifications, all messages will be delivered as a `HTTP POST` request on the configured chatbot's messages URL. These messages have a JSON format as defined on [LIME PROTOCOL](http://limeprotocol.org/#message). A sample of a received message is presented below.

```
{
  "id": "99cf454e-f25d-4ebd-831f-e48a1c612cd4",
  "from": "551100001111@0mn.io/4ac58r6e3",
  "to": "blipmessaginghubapp@msging.net",
  "type": "text/plain",
  "content": "Help"
}
```

4. Sending notifications

In order to correctly show the message history, it is important that the chatbots send notifications of messages processed to originator clients.

For each message processed, it is important to send a notification with the `consumed` event. In case of problems, the chatbot must send a notification with the `failed` event. The request must contain an authorization header (`Authorization`) with `Key` type, as showed on chatbot settings.

For instance, imagine that the received message from the example above (whit id **99cf454e-f25d-4ebd-831f-e48a1c612cd4**) was processed with success. The code below shows a complete notification request including the headers and the body request.
```
POST https://{{contract_id}}.http.msging.net/notifications HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Key bWVzc2FnaW5naHViQHRha2VuZXQuY29tLmJyOjEyMzQ=
Content-Length: 131

{
  "id": "99cf454e-f25d-4ebd-831f-e48a1c612cd4",
  "from": "551100001111@0mn.io/4ac58r6e3",
  "event": "consumed"
}
```


5. Sending commands

In order to use Blip's [extensions]() (like schedule and directory), it is necessary to send commands. To do that, a `HTTP POST` request on `/commands` URL must be made.

For instance, send a command to schedule some message:

```
POST https://{{contract_id}}.http.msging.net/commands HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Key bWVzc2FnaW5naHViQHRha2VuZXQuY29tLmJyOjEyMzQ=
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 393

{  
  "id":"2",
  "to":"postmaster@scheduler.msging.net",
  "method":"set",
  "uri":"/schedules",
  "type":"application/vnd.iris.schedule+json",
  "resource":{  
    "message":{  
      "id":"ad19adf8-f5ec-4fff-8aeb-2e7ebe9f7a67",
      "to":"553100001111@0mn.io",
      "type":"text/plain",
      "content":"Scheduled Message"
    },
    "when":"2016-07-25T17:50:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

The command response is immediately delivered on HTTP response, as below:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Date: Mon, 12 Sep 2016 17:35:02 GMT
Content-Length: 131

{  
  "id":"2",
  "from":"postmaster@scheduler.msging.net/#irismsging1",
  "to":"blipmessaginghubapp@msging.net",
  "method":"set",
  "status":"success"
}

```
