### Sending commands

<blockquote class="lang-specific csharp">
<p>ISender interface also enables send commands to the server, as the following sample:</p>
</blockquote>

```csharp
// For this case, the command response is received on a synchronous way.

public class PlainTextMessageReceiver : IMessageReceiver
{
    private readonly ISender _sender;
    private readonly Settings _settings;

    public PlainTextMessageReceiver(ISender sender, Settings settings)
    {
        _sender = sender;
        _settings = settings;
    }

    public async Task ReceiveAsync(Message message, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var command = new Command {
            Id = 1,
            Method = CommandMethod.Get,
            Uri = new LimeUri("/account")
        };
        
        var response = await _sender.ProcessCommandAsync(command, cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

```javascript
var pingCommand = {
    id: Lime.Guid(),
    uri: '/ping',
    method: 'get'
};

messagingHubClient
    .sendCommand(pingCommand)
    .then(function (commandResponse) {
        utils.logLimeCommand(pingCommand, 'Ping sent');
        utils.logLimeCommand(commandResponse, 'Ping response');
    })
    .catch(function (err) {
        utils.logMessage('An error occurred: ' + err);
    });

```

```python
command = Command.from_json(
    {
        'id': '1',
        'method': 'get',
        'uri': '/ping'
    }
)

response = await client.process_command_async(command)
# or sync
# response = client.process_command(command)
```

```http

    "method":"set",
    "uri":"/schedules",
    "type":"application/vnd.iris.schedule+json",
    "resource":{  
    "message":{  
        "id":"ad19adf8-f5ec-4fff-8aeb-2e7ebe9f7a67",
        "to":"553100001111@0mn.io",
        "type":"text/plain",
        "content":"Scheduled Message"
    },
    "when":"2016-07-25T17:50:00.000Z"
    }
}
```

In order to use the Blip's extensions (like schedule and directory), it is necessary to send commands.
